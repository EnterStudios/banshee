Installation
============
This application has been built upon the Banshee PHP framework. Use the
following steps to install a Banshee based website.


Configure your webserver
------------------------
Use the directory 'public' as the webroot directory and allow PHP execution.
Banshee needs URL rewriting. If you use the Hiawatha webserver, you can use
the following configuration:

	UrlToolkit {
		ToolkitID = banshee
		RequestURI isfile Return
		Match ^/(css|files|fonts|images|js)(/|$) Return
		Match ^/(favicon.ico|robots.txt)$ Return
		Match [^?]*(\?.*)? Rewrite /index.php$1
	}

	Directory {
		DirectoryID = files
		Path = /files
		StartFile = index.html
		ShowIndex = yes
		ExecuteCGI = no
	}

	Directory {
		DirectoryID = static
		Path = /css, /fonts, /images, /js
		ExpirePeriod = 2 weeks
	}

	VirtualHost {
		...
		UseToolkit = banshee
		UseDirectory = static, files
	}


For Apache, there is a .htaccess file in the 'public' directory which contains
the required URL rewriting rules. If you use another webserver, you have to
convert the rewriting rules to your webserver's configuration.


Configure PHP
-------------
Banshee requires at least PHP v7.0 and needs PHP's JSON, MySQL and XML module.
If you use the Banshee image library, you need PHP's GD module. Make sure the
date.timezone setting in php.ini has been set correctly.


Configure your database
-----------------------
Open the website in your browser and follow the instructions on your screen to
setup your database. In case of an error, add /setup to the URL to continue the
installation process.


Configure Cronjob
-----------------
Configure cronjob to run the script database/backup_database once per day.


Configure Banshee
-----------------
Go to the Settings administration page in Banshee's CMS and replace the present
e-mail addresses with your own. Before going live, set the DEBUG_MODE flag in
the file settings/website.conf to 'no' and disable the setup module in the file
settings/private_modules.conf.
